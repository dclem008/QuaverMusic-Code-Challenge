# New Hire Code Test
This coding challenge will be sent to potential new hires to test their debugging skills. 

# What the project does
* Uses the Github API to pull top repos.
* Loops through the top repos and grab the URLs.
* Encrypts the URLs and stores them in a text file, only if that URL does not already exist (no duplicates).
* The Github API will be called three times. In the View you will see a boolean if the text file contains any duplicates for the three API calls.

# What you need to do
* This program is broken in several places. Step through and find where the program is broken.
* The expected result is all three API call duplicate checks return false.

Remember there should be no duplicates of any URLs in the text file!

# How to deliver 
* Clone down the solution and copy the QuaverCodeChallenge folder into your own GitHub repo.
* Send us the link (email implementation@QuaverMusic.com) to your GitHub solution when complete.

# Comments
* Most of my comments through debugging process can be found in commit description,
    although I will add, I looked for another problem which I think it may be inside ErrorViewModel.
    Because I tried to replicate a similar Model design and return value on Razor page and was unauccessful.
    I couldn't find a way to solve that, if it even were an issue in the first place. If I may ask, did the
    ErrorViewModel actually had an error in it?
* Had a lot of fun going through this, thank you!
